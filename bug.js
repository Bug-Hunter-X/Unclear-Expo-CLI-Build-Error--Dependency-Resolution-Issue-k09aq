This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to properly resolve or locate necessary dependencies for your project. This might be due to issues with the package manager (npm or yarn), corrupted local caches, or problems with network connectivity while installing packages.  Here's a simplified example showing a missing dependency that could lead to this kind of error during the build process:

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import NonExistentComponent from './NonExistentComponent'; // Missing component

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
      <NonExistentComponent/>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this case, `NonExistentComponent` isn't defined, and the app might fail to build or run, generating an obscure error message related to missing modules or dependencies.
