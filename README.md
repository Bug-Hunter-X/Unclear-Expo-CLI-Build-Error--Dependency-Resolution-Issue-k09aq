# Unclear Expo CLI Build Error: Dependency Resolution Issue

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI produces an unclear error message during the build process, likely related to issues in resolving project dependencies.  The error message itself is not specific enough to easily pinpoint the root cause.

## Problem Description

The Expo CLI build process fails, returning a confusing or generic error message that doesn't clearly indicate the problem.  This makes debugging difficult, and requires investigating dependencies, package managers (npm or yarn), and local Expo caches.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on systematically checking the most common causes of dependency resolution failures:

1. **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies listed in `package.json` are correctly specified and exist.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clear the cache and rebuild the project using the Expo CLI's clean commands (`expo prebuild --clean` and/or `expo start --clear`).
3. **Check Network Connectivity:** Confirm that the device has a stable internet connection for package downloads.
4. **Check package.json and package-lock.json/yarn.lock:** Manually verify dependency versions and resolve any conflicts.
5. **Restart the Expo CLI:** A simple restart can sometimes resolve transient issues.
6. **Reinstall Node Modules:** Delete `node_modules` and reinstall using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo start`. Observe the unclear error message.
4. Follow the steps in the `bugSolution.js` file to resolve the issue.
